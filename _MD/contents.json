You don't have to have a licence to use it,\nand you can use it with cheap littly esp32 devices. \n\n\n## Frequency\n- It runs on the 915 Frequency making it avaible to the public without a licence. It runns at a very low power only about half a watt. But still people making 50k communications very easily\n\n## Use Cases\n- Since Meshtastic is off the grid and is a mesh network you can use it anywhere. From family trips to the middle of the desert it will stil work. \n- Meshtastic works best if you have 5 to 10 people and a base station. \n- This way you have good coverage and the messages are able to relay of many people to get to the person they need to\n\n## Heltec V3\n- The Heltec V3 is one of the most populare devices people use for meshtastic, It has Bluetooth and screen a button and for only **20$** Now thats a good deal.\n- There are some downsides like how it runs on the power hungry ESP32.\n- This sucker will only last about a day on a 2000 milamp hour battery\n\n## RAK Wiskblock\n- RAK has entered the game with lots of NRF based boards\n- The NRF chip draws way less power than the ESP32 and im easily about to get 2 weeks on a 2000 milamp hour battery.\n- This board is best for solar repeaters and places you need very low power\n\n## Solar Repeaters\n- Sence this whole system is a Mesh network that means that all node / devices will be repeating messages. This means we can cover a very large area with only a couple of devices. \n- Solar Repeaters are supper nice to links those last couple nodes and make the connection more reliable.\n- These things are small take next to no sun and can be put just about anywhere\n- I recently just installed on one a tree about 500feet up on a small hill / moutain to cover that last little bit.\n### Meshtastic\n[Meshtastic.org](https://meshtastic.org)\n",

Art is a huge part of the how the game looks and feels. Implementing a good color pallet to much more. \n## Parallaxing\n    - Next, parallaxing, Seems like such a daunting task but with a few lines of code I can adjust like clouds based on the scrolling of the camera to make a simple parallaxing effect. \n## Smoothly Scrolling Camera\n    - Lastly, I can make the camera smoothly scroll based on how far away the camera is from the player. If it is more away then I want it to get to the player faster. But if it is closer I need it to get to the player slower\n## Code Improvements\n    -  First, I need to stop loading Images into each class. I should have a globals or game class that has all the pictures and I use that for each class. For the collision for a platformer I should have a function that returns are the possible tiles around it that I need to collide with. Lastly, For making the level I should make some boilerplate code that will allow me to use the TILED Editor for adding and saving levels to a game much easier or just make my own.\n",

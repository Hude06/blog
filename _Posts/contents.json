Art is a huge part of the how the game looks and feels. Implementing a good color pallet to much more. \n## Parallaxing\n    - Next, parallaxing, Seems like such a daunting task but with a few lines of code I can adjust like clouds based on the scrolling of the camera to make a simple parallaxing effect. \n## Smoothly Scrolling Camera\n    - Lastly, I can make the camera smoothly scroll based on how far away the camera is from the player. If it is more away then I want it to get to the player faster. But if it is closer I need it to get to the player slower\n## Code Improvements\n    -  First, I need to stop loading Images into each class. I should have a globals or game class that has all the pictures and I use that for each class. For the collision for a platformer I should have a function that returns are the possible tiles around it that I need to collide with. Lastly, For making the level I should make some boilerplate code that will allow me to use the TILED Editor for adding and saving levels to a game much easier or just make my own.\n",

Hell nah, But there are some small things I want to start doing to make the player feel more emersed and not just feel like the game is plain.

There cool and all but there are so many parameters its crazy. But yeah they can make a huge difference in a jump or when you shoot. You can also add a small jump noice or sound-effects for shooting.

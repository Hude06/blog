Like coyote time in a platformer game where the player can still jump even if there a couple frames of the platform\n    - You can also do small things like give the player a diferent jump height by how long they are holding the space down for. Just keep adding -velocity until you hit a max height and if you let go just stop\n## Art\n    - Art is a huge things, Do I make good art. Hell nah, But there are some small things I want to start doing to make the player feel more emersed and not just feel like the game is plain. First, if you just have a background some clouds anything. So much better. Maybe lets make the clouds scroll really slowly. What does that remid you of, LIFE?? .. A video game is kida just like real life\n## Sound / Particals\n    - Particals just suck, If you have to make a partical engine you will agree with me. There cool and all but there are so many peramiters its crazy. But yeah they can make a huge diferentce in a jump or when you shoot. You can also add a small jump noice or soundeffects for shooting.

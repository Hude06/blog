Art is a huge part of the how the game looks and feels. Implementing a good color pallet to much more. \n## Parallaxing\nNext, parallaxing, Seems like such a daunting task but with a few lines of code I can adjust like clouds based on the scrolling of the camera to make a simple parallaxing effect. \n## Smoothly Scrolling Camera\nLastly, I can make the camera smoothly scroll based on how far away the camera is from the player. If it is more away then I want it to get to the player faster. But if it is closer I need it to get to the player slower\n## Code Improvements\nFirst, I need to stop loading Images into each class. I should have a globals or game class that has all the pictures and I use that for each class. For the collision for a platformer I should have a function that returns are the possible tiles around it that I need to collide with. Lastly, For making the level I should make some boilerplate code that will allow me to use the TILED Editor for adding and saving levels to a game much easier or just make my own.\n",

The hard part of the story is implementing it. The idea thats easy, Putting it in the game not so much\n\n## Feel\n    - Ive been doing some research on different things people use in their games to make the player feel more fluid. Like coyote time in a platformer game where the player can still jump even if there a couple frames of the platform\n    - You can also do small things like give the player a different jump height by how long they are holding the space down for. Just keep adding -velocity until you hit a max height and if you let go just stop\n## Art\n    - Art is a huge things, Do I make good art. Hell nah, But there are some small things I want to start doing to make the player feel more emersed and not just feel like the game is plain. First, if you just have a background some clouds anything. So much better. Maybe lets make the clouds scroll really slowly. What does that remind you of, LIFE?? .. A video game is kinda just like real life\n## Sound / Particles\n    - Particles just suck, If you have to make a particle engine you will agree with me. There cool and all but there are so many parameters its crazy. But yeah they can make a huge difference in a jump or when you shoot. You can also add a small jump noice or sound-effects for shooting. Lets your mind run wild\n\n\nAll in all these are some simple things that I need to work on that I though I would share. Lets see if anyone is even reading this ...\n\n",

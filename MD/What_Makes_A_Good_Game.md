# What does make a good game. I have no Idea but lets see ...

## Story
    - First I think the story is one of the most important things in a game. The hard part of the story is implementing it. The idea thats easy, Putting it in the game not so much

## Feel
    - Ive been doing some research on different things people use in their games to make the player feel more fluid. Like coyote time in a platformer game where the player can still jump even if there a couple frames of the platform
    - You can also do small things like give the player a different jump height by how long they are holding the space down for. Just keep adding -velocity until you hit a max height and if you let go just stop
## Art
    - Art is a huge things, Do I make good art. Hell nah, But there are some small things I want to start doing to make the player feel more emersed and not just feel like the game is plain. First, if you just have a background some clouds anything. So much better. Maybe lets make the clouds scroll really slowly. What does that remind you of, LIFE?? .. A video game is kinda just like real life
## Sound / Particles
    - Particles just suck, If you have to make a particle engine you will agree with me. There cool and all but there are so many parameters its crazy. But yeah they can make a huge difference in a jump or when you shoot. You can also add a small jump noice or sound-effects for shooting. Lets your mind run wild


All in all these are some simple things that I need to work on that I though I would share. Lets see if anyone is even reading this ...
